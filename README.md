# MUSA 650: Machine Learning in Remote Sensing

## Week7: Satellite imaging object classification, cross-validation, SVM

This repository contains:

- [Object detection in satellite images, EuroSat challenge](PrjC1_EuroSat_Classification.ipynb)
- [Cross-validation examples](Nested_CV_Example.ipynb)
- [SVM introduction](SVM_BriefPres.pdf)


### Access to colab notebooks and datasets:

You can run this week's satellite imaging notebooks on "Google Colab"

Sharing link for Jupyter notebooks:

Steps for replicating "PrjC2_EuroSat_Classification_CV.ipynb":

- Copy shared datasets in a google drive folder
- Go to Google Colab, copy the Jupyter notebook there (or copy it in your Google Drive, click on it and select "open in Colab")
- Run the notebook (!!! you may need to edit the path to data)
